Each block is 12px square. My script simply assigns a random multiple of 12 to the background image's X &amp; Y position. To keep the visual smooth, I make sure the new position isn't too close to the old one and that the image still covers all of the screen. MAGIC!"

(Me = :-O) So, I gave it a whirl. The \"busticated\" text / logo is an exported SVG path. The tricky bit with this one (at least for me) was cleaning up. After a certain number of circles are drawn, I start deleting the old ones."

Ages ago I came across a vintage <a href=\"http://www.maritime.org/fleetsub/sonar/chap4.htm\">Submarine Sonar Operator's Manual</a> and thought it might make a cool show poster. I got voted down but always had a soft spot for the image. When I was looking around for my next experiment, I thought \"perfect! I'll just animate some bits and toss it up there\". Yeah. <em>Wrong</em>. On the bright-side, a total lesson in feature-creep. Drag the sub around and click the destroyer to start the search. We got a little HTML5 audio action in there.
