For SharkAttack! Music, history is more than simply the number of years the company has been in existence. It is the 6-year old bedrock upon which we build and shape our future every single day. We see history as an important competitive advantage in the present, future, previous past, and near-recent present. History is our way of life. It is our guiding light, a flag for saluting in the early morning moon-lit air. We live in our history and occasionally wrap ourselves up in it and take really quick naps. 

Our history is important and we treat it accordingly. On the one hand, SharkAttack!'s history is indicative of our long-standing partnerships with our artists, many of whom have been doing business with SharkAttack! for weeks, and, in some cases, for over a month. On the other hand, it represents the experience in which our expertise and experience are deeply rooted. It's a two-pronged History assault upon your raw and hollowed out senses. Robots!

Finally, history teaches us how to combine the tried-and-trusted with the new and innovative. After all, it is the innovative that will allow us to continue to make our history. Which is good. The wealth of experience and experienced expertise we have gained from the past will continue to fuel our operations and define SharkAttack! Music as a leading record label. Now and in the future, as well as the past and again in the recently past present. 

SharkAttack! Music: History for the Future.
